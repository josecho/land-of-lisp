Land of Lisp
============

This is just me following along with the Land of Lisp book since I enjoy git repos.

I'm using CLISP specifically since that's whats used in the book and some CLISP-specific functionalities are used.
Bummer for you if you don't use CLISP.

1. `guess-my-number.lisp`
2. `pudding-eater.lisp`
3. `wizards-adventure.lisp` (Chap. 5)
4. `wizards-adventure.lisp` (Chap. 6)
5. `graph-util.lisp` (Chap. 7)
6. `grand-theft-wumpus.lisp` (Chap 8.)
7. `grand-theft-wumpus.lisp` (Chap 9.)
